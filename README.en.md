- Fixed several `bugs` where user quota cache inconsistencies with `DB` data caused billing anomalies
- Removed meaningless original price-related styles from log functionality
- Optimized email rule validation
- Optimized several `UI` interactions
- Optimized logic for disabled channel email notifications
- Optimized `VertexAI` authentication caching
- ...

## Deployment
